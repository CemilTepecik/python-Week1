# ======================================ROCK-PAPER-SCÄ°SSORS================================================
# Developer: Cemil Tepecik
# Date:31.01.2021
# {This is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with
# an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with
# the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign
# except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
# A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.
# Winner is determined by the rule: ...>rock>scissors>paper>rock>scissors>paper>...}
